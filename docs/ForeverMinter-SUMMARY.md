## 💡 Quick Reference

### Core Concepts

**The Pool:**
- EnumerableSet of available NFT serials
- Fed by: treasury deposits, user stakes, refunds
- Depleted by: mints
- Managed by: admins (emergency only)

**Discounts (3 Types):**
1. **Whitelist:** Fixed %, WL-only
2. **Holder:** NFT-based, global per-serial tracking
3. **Sacrifice:** Exclusive, highest %

**Discount Stacking:**
- ✅ WL + Holder
- ❌ Sacrifice + anything else

**Payment Flow:**
- LAZY: Via LazyGasStation (handles transfer + burn)
- HBAR: Direct to contract
- Dual: Both at once

**Refund System:**
- Time-window based (e.g., 60 minutes)
- Partial refund (e.g., 95%)
- Based on actual paid amount
- NFTs return to pool

| Serial discount tracking | Global per-serial (not per-wallet) |
| Batch sizes | 50 mint, 20 sacrifice |
| Discount tiers | Array-based (flexible) |
| Available serials | EnumerableSet (O(1) operations) |
| Admin system | Multi-admin with EnumerableSet |
| LAZY payment | Via LazyGasStation.drawLazyFrom() |

## Version History

### Version 1.0.5 (Current)
**Release Date:** October 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Testing

**Key Changes:**
- **DRY Architecture Refactoring:** Implemented single-source-of-truth for slot consumption
- **Breaking Change:** `calculateMintCost()` now returns 5 values instead of 3
  - Added: `holderSlotsUsed` and `wlSlotsUsed` to return signature
  - Previous: `(uint256 hbar, uint256 lazy, uint256 discount)`
  - Current: `(uint256 hbar, uint256 lazy, uint256 discount, uint256 holderSlots, uint256 wlSlots)`
- **New Struct:** `MintCostResult` to avoid stack-too-deep errors
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fixed holder slot over-consumption in edge cases
  - Fixed WL slot over-consumption in edge cases
  - Eliminated duplicate waterfall logic in mintNFT Steps 7-8

**Technical Improvements:**
- Contract size optimized: 18.384 KiB (improved from v1.0.4)
- Simplified mintNFT logic by consuming pre-calculated slot counts
- Enhanced code maintainability via DRY principles

**Documentation Updates:**
- Created ForeverMinter-V1.0.5-MIGRATION.md guide
- Updated ForeverMinter-TESTING.md with DRY validation tests (Section 11.7.7)
- Updated all documentation for 5-value return consistency

**Migration Guide:** See `ForeverMinter-V1.0.5-MIGRATION.md` for integration instructions

### Version 1.0.4
